Project Reflection – Airgead Banking Investment Calculator
Project Summary and Problem Solved

The Airgead Banking Investment Calculator was designed to help users understand how an investment grows over time with and without monthly deposits. The program calculates yearly balances and earned interest based on user input, providing a clear comparison that supports financial decision making. From an Agile perspective, the project delivers a focused solution that meets defined requirements while remaining adaptable for future enhancements.

What I Did Particularly Well

I did particularly well with structuring the program using object oriented principles and separation of concerns. The InvestmentAccount class encapsulates investment data and calculation logic, while Main.cpp handles user interaction and program flow. This approach aligns with Agile best practices by keeping the code modular, readable, and easy to extend. I also implemented formatted output and input validation to improve usability and maintain professional coding standards.

Areas for Improvement and Potential Enhancements

One area for improvement would be expanding input validation and error handling to cover additional edge cases, such as negative values or invalid interest rates. Another enhancement would be refactoring the program to support additional investment scenarios or configurable compounding intervals. These improvements would increase efficiency, security, and adaptability while allowing the product backlog to evolve based on user needs.

Most Challenging Code and How I Overcame It

The most challenging part of the project was correctly implementing the interest calculations over multiple years while keeping the logic clear and accurate. I overcame this by breaking the problem into smaller steps, testing calculations incrementally, and using structured loops to ensure correctness. This iterative approach reflects Agile development by validating functionality early and refining the solution through testing.

Transferable Skills From This Project

This project strengthened several transferable skills, including object oriented design, modular coding, debugging, and user focused development. These skills are directly applicable to future coursework and professional projects, especially in Agile and Scrum environments where incremental delivery, clean architecture, and adaptability are essential.

Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

I made the program maintainable and readable by using clear naming conventions, consistent formatting, and separating responsibilities across files. The use of header and implementation files allows future developers to modify or extend functionality without impacting unrelated code. This structure supports Agile principles by enabling continuous improvement and easy adaptation as requirements change.
